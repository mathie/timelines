  <h1>Sign in</h1>

  <p>
    You can sign in with your Google account, or with a GitHub account. (If you
    particularly want to sign in with another account, let me know and I'll see
    if I can add it!) If you've already signed in before, you should have
    access to all your timelines. If you haven't signed in before, I'll
    automatically create an account for you. I only store your name &amp; email
    address, and I promise not to do anything nefarious with either!
